Overview

This project is an image classification web application built using Streamlit and TensorFlow's ResNet50 model. 

The ResNet50 (Residual Network with 50 layers) is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on the ImageNet dataset, capable of recognizing 1,000 different object categories.

With this app, users can upload an image, and the model will classify it by predicting the top-3 most likely categories, along with their confidence scores. 

This makes it useful for quick and easy image recognition without requiring complex setup or deep learning expertise.

Why ResNet50?

State-of-the-art model for image classification

Pretrained on ImageNet, meaning it can recognize a wide variety of objects

Deep architecture with residual connections, allowing efficient training and high accuracy

This project demonstrates how deep learning models can be integrated into a user-friendly web interface, making AI-based image classification accessible to everyone.
